# Game"MINIRALLY"

This time I ported my QuickBasic 4.5 game called Minirally to TIC-80 , just for: fun, leard lua and enjoy TIC-80 console.

**Game description**

Drive a car, make a beeter planet collecting radioactive trash and stop to convert into energy. Have fun along 8 levels, that required much effort to design.
