# Game"8 Bit Minirally"

This time I ported my QuickBasic 4.5 game called Minirally to TIC-80 , just for: fun, leard lua and enjoy TIC-80 console.

**Game description**

## Installation

This game does not require installartion but you can download .tic file and play locally.

Another thing that you can do is run TIC-80 console and upload the game and modify it.

<b>Windows, play the game locally</b>

1-Download .zip file and uncompress to some localfolder.

2-Run the file "play.bat" (this will execute tic80.exe and automatically load 8_bit_minirally.tic)

NOTE: .local folder must be used to make fullscreen parameter works.

OPTIONAL 3-If you want to change the game code or something, after step 2 press ESC andthen F1. (I suggest read a little about TIC-80, just to get more fun)
