## Motivation

- NOTE: English is not my first language and the game has not localization, but I made a document with some translation see "doc" folder inside the .zip.

- The original motivations was learning about programming.

- I tried to make a simulation of a real life toy called mini rally (90's)

- This remake motivation is to share with the humanity this that I made.
